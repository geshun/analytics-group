### About Dataset

The file `emergency-calls.csv` contains emergency calls recorded in `2021` in a major city in USA.

`Report Date`: The month data was recorded.

`Emergency Count`: The total number of emergency calls.

`Average Wait Time`: The average time (in minutes) to respond to an emergency call.

### To Do

Import the following packages: `pandas, matplotlib`

```{python}

```

Read the `.csv` file as a `Pandas DataFrame`

```{python}

```

How many observations and features are in the emergency dataset?

```{python}

```

Does the dataset contain any missing values?

```{python}

```

Plot the `DataFrame` . What can you say about the plot output?

```{python}

```

How can we establish if the columns are in the desired data types? Are there any type conversion you want to do?

```{python}

```

Get the summary of the columns to know about the data distribution.

```{python}

```

Set the `Report Date` as the index of the `DataFrame`

```{python}

```

Plot the `DataFrame` again

```{python}

```

Convert the `Report Date` index to a datetime object and plot the `DataFrame` . Do you realize any difference in visualization?

```{python}

```

Discuss the information or knowledge you have gained about the data

Reset the index of the `DataFrame` so that we have 3 columns

```{python}

```

The column names have space in them (and thus can be used as attributes of the `DataFrame`). Do this to verify `df.columns`. Replace the spaces with underscore `_` and convert to lower case. For instance, `Report Date` should be `report_date`

```{python}

```

If the `report_date` field is not datetime object, convert it. Create a new column and call it `report_month` which contains the month name.

```{python}

```

Do you think the `report_month` field should be categorical? If yes how do you convert to categorical? Try providing order if you want to treat the field as categorical.

```{python}

```

Which months in `2021` recorded the maximum and minimum emergency call count?

```{python}

```

Find the average call volume for each quarter of the year

```{python}

```

Is there a correlation between call volume and response time? What can you say about the nature of the correlation?

```{python}

```

Extract a feature from the Emergency Count that can be used as a base predictor for call volume in January 2022. Use the same principle to predict the average wait time.

```{python}

```
