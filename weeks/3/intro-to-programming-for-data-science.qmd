### Ice Breaker

How do copy the entire list without using the `.copy()` method?

```{python}
revenues = [12000, 23000, 15000, 10000, 18000]
```

```{python}

```

### Generator

```{python}
def double(x_list):
  result = []
  for val in x_list:
    result.append(val * 2)
  return result

double(revenues)

def double(x_list):
  return [val * 2 for val in x_list]
```

Turn the `double()` function into a generator

```{python}

```

### Recursion

```{python}
def product(x_list):
  result = 1
  for val in x_list:
    result = result * val
  return result

product(revenues)
```

Write the above `product()` function as a recursion.

```{python}

```

### Lambda Expression

```{python}
# with the help of len and sum find the arithmetic mean using lambda expression
```

## Store the revenue year

We want to record the year of the revenue as part of the data. How do we do that? Try list of list!

```{python}

```

## Dictionary

Have multiple keys - one for each year

```{python}

```

Have a single key

```{python}

```

### Quick Pandas

Turn the dictionary into `pandas` `Series` and/or `DataFrame`

```{python}
from pandas import DataFrame, Series
```

```{python}

```
